 1. Running etcdctl get foo shows an error: certificate has expired or is not yet valid: current time ... is after ..., it's clear the server time is one year ahead, to fix set the server time to the actual time, for ex: sudo date -s "last year" (Next "clue" gives the solution).

2. Not easy to see unless looking for it (for example using tcpdump) but there's an iptables rule that redirects TCP traffic going to the etcd port :2379 into port :443 , and there's an Nginx server listening to that port: sudo /usr/sbin/iptables -t nat -L, deleting this rule will fix the remaining issue, for ex: sudo /usr/sbin/iptables -t nat -F
